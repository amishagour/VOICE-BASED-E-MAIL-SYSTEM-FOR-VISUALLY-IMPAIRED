### INTRODUCTION

Internet plays a vital role in today’s world of communication. Today the world is running on the basis of internet. No work can be done without use of internet. Electronic mail 
i.e., email is the most important part in day-to-day life. But some of the people in today’s world don’t know how to make use of internet, some are blind, or some are illiterate. Nowadays there are various technologies available in this world like screen readers, ASR, TTS, STT, etc. but these are not that much efficient for them. Around 39 million people are blind, and 246 people have low vision and also 82 of people living with blindness are 50 aged and above. We have to make some internet facilities to them so they can use internet. Therefore, we came up with our project as voice-based email system for blinds which will help a lot to visually impaired peoples and also illiterate peoples for sending their mails.The users don’t need to remember any basic information about keyboard shortcuts as well as mouse location. The user simply sends the mail through his/her voice using the instructions provided in our system such as receivers mail Id, subject, content (attachments, images, videos, etc.). Our system also provides Voice converter (Text-To-Speech), so the user doesn’t need to worry about the message (mail) that he/she has sent.
